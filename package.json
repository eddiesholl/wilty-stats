I often unwind with an episode of the british panel comedy show [Would I Lie To You?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Would_I_Lie_to_You%3F_episodes) In one particualr episode, it seemed like the female guests had their suggestions ignored by the team leaders. It got me thinking that it might be a great dataset to dig a little further into.",
