# Introduction

This project started with some self reflection and a simple observation. I often unwind with an episode of the british panel comedy show [Would I Lie To You?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Would_I_Lie_to_You%3F_episodes) In one particualr episode, it seemed like the female guests had their suggestions ignored by the team leaders. It got me thinking that it might be a great dataset to dig a little further into.

It's essentially a convergence of 3 things I love:

* Skepticism - I wonder if that's really how it is, or just confirmation bias?
* Quantitive analysis - Nothing better than bringing some numbers to a slippery problem
* Offbeat british humour - This seems as harmless as it can be. Does bias dwell even here?

I'm certain there's no overt ill will within the show, and I'm sure they actively go out of their way to make their guests as welcome and respected as possible. In some ways that makes this all the more interesting. Does bias emerge even in such a welcoming and respectful enviroment?

## Data sources
For now, I'm planning on pulling the episode and team lists from the wikipedia page linked above. I haven't found any other fansite resources where individual round results have been compiled, so that side is going ot require some good old fashioned screen time. No complaints here.

## Manual updates
If you make manual edits to the json data file, the atom plugin 'Pretty JSON' is a reliable way to reformat the file so its layout stays consistent with the scraper script. This helps to avoid whiespace churn in the diffs on this file.
